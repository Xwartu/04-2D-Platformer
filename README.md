C220 2D Platformer 12/12/20

Building a cursory platformer for MSCH-C220 Fall.

## Implementation
Which features you included

## References
Used a lot of CC0 Public Domain Assets so no need to credit (including a lot of Kenney.nl assets), though i would've credited but forgot to keep track at the beginning. If I create something, I will claim so, otherwise assume I didn't.

## Future Development
Possibly one day. 

## Created by
Joshua Tonner
