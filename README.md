# 04-2D-Platformer (King's Landing)
C220 2D Platformer 12/14/20

Building a cursory platformer for MSCH-C220 Fall.

## Implementation
W - Jump
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
W+D - Move right and prepare to Jump
W+A - Move Left and prepare to Jump

Need to collect a singular coin to beat level 1

Need to collect 3 coins to beat level 2 and win

On level 2 there is a lives orb if you need it, but 15 should be enough to finish. All jumps are doable as far as I know. 

2 slightly different enemy variations between the levels

Everything should track and clear accordingly. 

MAY NEED TO ADJUST SOUND TO BE QUIETER! Don't want to accidentally blow out your ear drums, as sound effects don't stop even if the track is killed. (Didn't have time)

A rudimentary save load system that only remembers the last level you ran over "Save" on and will load you into it when you run over "Load". 

## References
Used a lot of CC0 Public Domain Assets so no need to credit (including a lot of Kenney.nl assets), though I would've likely credited but forgot to keep track at the beginning. I reuse CC0 assets between projects, and double checked the ones I wasn't sure of thorugh my downloads list. 

Some assets are made by me, such as the grass and dirt block in level 1, as well as the Lives Orb and the background for the start screen. Trying to create assets sunk a lot of time into this that didn't produce a lot of results. 

## Future Development
Possibly one day.
